# Networking Tools

This project is a series of python scripts for testing networks and for gathering infomation about networks.
All the python scripts are based to work on a Linux system and will also likely run on MacOS. Very few of 
this scripts will work on a windows machine.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install to get the software working on your system.
Some of these scripts will need third party modules form pip3.

First off we need to install python and git if it is not alreaqdy installed:
```
sudo apt-get install python3 git
```

Next we need to install pip3:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

Next we need to install the module from pip3:
```
sudo pip3 install sockets
```

That should be all the setup done and finished.

### Installing

Now we are going to go through a step by step guide on how to install the applications.

First we will download the scripts. (This saves the repository to your current directory.)

```
git clone https://github.com/Tom-2E0EEJ/Networking_Tools
```

Now we must navigate to the file the scripts are in.

```
cd Networking_Tools/Applications
```

To list all the current applications tyoe: (This display all scripts.)
``` 
ls
```
